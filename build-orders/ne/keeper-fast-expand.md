### Source
This build order was given by Grubby to tier 2 subs. I feel a bit unethical sharing it publicly
but I'm mostly using this repo for my own use at the moment. I WILL remove this at Grubby's request.

### Notes:
A very early expansion grants you a bi tier 1 army quickly.
- VS Orc, mix archers, hunts, dryads, and MGs as needed
- VS UD, a bunch of archers, then hipporider and mass faery
- VS HU, dryad/MG army is best while expo and basetrade
- don't play this vs NE
- This build focues on NE vs UD. VS Orc, early hunter's hall.
